### 1. Update the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table by modifying the month_year column to be a date data type with the start of the month

```ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
   ALTER COLUMN month_year TYPE DATE USING to_date('01-' || month_year, 'DD-MM-YYYY');
```

2. What is count of records in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics for each month_year value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
```![2](https://github.com/hazalsezgin/case/assets/77546910/44fde222-5973-40de-94a2-eed34d9677c1)

SELECT 
  month_year, COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year NULLS FIRST;
```

3.What do you think we should do with these null values in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics
```

```

4.How many interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about the other way around?
```
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT map.id) AS map_id_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT metrics.interest_id::varchar) AS metrics_id_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN map.id is NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_in_metric,
  SUM(CASE WHEN metrics.interest_id is NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_in_map
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
FULL OUTER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON metrics.interest_id::integer = map.id;
```

5.Summarise the id values in the fresh_segments.interest_map by its total record count in this table
```
```

6.What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column.
```
SELECT *
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = metrics.interest_id::integer
WHERE metrics.interest_id = '21246'
  AND metrics._month IS NOT NULL;
```

7.Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map table? Do you think these values are valid and why?
```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = CAST(metrics.interest_id AS integer)
WHERE TO_DATE(metrics.month_year || '-01', 'MM-YYYY') < map.created_at::DATE;
```

### 1.Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?
```
SELECT
    month_year,
    COUNT(*) AS interest_count
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year;
```
![int 1](https://github.com/hazalsezgin/case/assets/77546910/2d41d78e-916f-4639-a426-709d6c04580e)

2.Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
```
WITH month_yearPer_interest AS(
SELECT 
    interest_id,
    COUNT(month_year) AS month_year_counts
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
)
SELECT 
    month_year_counts,
    COUNT(interest_id) AS interest_count,
    ROUND(100*SUM(COUNT(interest_id)) OVER(ORDER BY month_year_counts DESC)/ SUM(COUNT(interest_id)) OVER(), 2) AS cumulative_percent
FROM month_yearPer_interest
GROUP BY month_year_counts
ORDER BY month_year_counts DESC;
```
![int2](https://github.com/hazalsezgin/case/assets/77546910/1594ac25-aa0f-4d50-94b4-4f611ec59815)

3.If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
```
WITH unremoved_records AS(
SELECT 
    interest_id
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY interest_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) >=6
)
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS removed_records
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM unremoved_records
        WHERE interest_metrics.interest_id = unremoved_records.interest_id);
```

![int4](https://github.com/hazalsezgin/case/assets/77546910/406e8990-8b26-47ac-89bc-b18c8de45c43)

4.Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
```

```

5.How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their composition and ranking values? What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?

```
